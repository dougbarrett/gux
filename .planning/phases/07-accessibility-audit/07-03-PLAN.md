<objective>
Create consolidated accessibility audit report with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance matrix and remediation priorities for Phases 8-11.

Purpose: Transform component-level findings into an actionable remediation plan that maps to the remaining accessibility phases.
Output: A11Y-AUDIT.md with compliance matrix, prioritized issues, and phase mapping.

# Subsequent phases for mapping:
# - Phase 8: ARIA & Semantic Markup (screen reader support, labels, roles, live regions)
# - Phase 9: Keyboard Navigation (comprehensive keyboard support)
# - Phase 10: Visual Accessibility (focus indicators, contrast, reduced motion)
# - Phase 11: A11y Testing Infrastructure (axe-core integration)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create WCAG 2.1 AA compliance matrix</name>

  <action>
Consolidate findings from 07-01-FINDINGS.md and 07-02-FINDINGS.md into a comprehensive audit report.

**Structure A11Y-AUDIT.md as:**

```markdown
# GoQuery Accessibility Audit Report

**Audit Date:** [date]
**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA
**Components Audited:** 25

## Executive Summary

- Total issues found: [count]
- Critical (P0): [count]
- High (P1): [count]
- Medium (P2): [count]
- Low (P3): [count]

## Compliance Matrix

| WCAG Criterion | Status | Components Affected | Phase |
|----------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Partial | Form, Table | 8 |
| 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose | Missing | Input, Select | 8 |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | Partial | Modal, Tabs | 9 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## By Component

### Interactive Components
[Summary of 07-01 findings]

### Form Components
[Summary of 07-02 form findings]

### Navigation Components
[Summary of 07-02 nav findings]

### Feedback Components
[Summary of 07-02 feedback findings]
```

Map each WCAG criterion to status: Compliant, Partial, Missing, N/A.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create prioritized remediation plan for Phases 8-11</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/07-accessibility-audit/A11Y-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Add remediation priorities section to A11Y-AUDIT.md that maps issues to Phases 8-11.

**Add these sections:**

```markdown
## Remediation Priorities

### P0 - Critical (Blockers)
Issues that prevent access entirely for users with disabilities.
[List with component and WCAG reference]

### P1 - High (Major Barriers)
Significant barriers that impede usage.
[List with component and WCAG reference]

### P2 - Medium (Minor Barriers)
Issues that cause difficulty but workarounds exist.
[List with component and WCAG reference]

### P3 - Low (Enhancements)
Best practices and enhancements beyond minimum compliance.
[List with component and WCAG reference]

## Phase Mapping

### Phase 8: ARIA & Semantic Markup
[Issues to address - roles, labels, live regions]

### Phase 9: Keyboard Navigation
[Issues to address - keyboard access, focus management]

### Phase 10: Visual Accessibility
[Issues to address - focus indicators, contrast, motion]

### Phase 11: Testing Infrastructure
[Testing patterns to implement]

## Baseline Metrics

- Components with keyboard support: X/25
- Components with ARIA labels: X/25
- Components with visible focus: X/25
- Components with proper roles: X/25
```

Ensure each issue is assigned to exactly one phase based on nature of fix.
