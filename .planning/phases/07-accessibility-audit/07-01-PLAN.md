<objective>
Audit interactive components against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria to identify accessibility gaps.

Purpose: Establish baseline accessibility status for complex interactive components that require keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.
Output: Detailed findings document for Modal, Dropdown, CommandPalette, ConfirmDialog, Combobox, Tabs, Accordion, and Table components.

**WCAG 2.1 AA Criteria for Interactive Components:**

1. **Keyboard Accessible (2.1)**
   - 2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality via keyboard
   - 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: Focus can move away
   - 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts: Customizable shortcuts

2. **Focus (2.4)**
   - 2.4.3 Focus Order: Logical sequence
   - 2.4.7 Focus Visible: Focus indicator visible

3. **Predictable (3.2)**
   - 3.2.1 On Focus: No unexpected context changes
   - 3.2.2 On Input: No unexpected context changes

4. **Name, Role, Value (4.1.2)**
   - Proper ARIA roles, states, properties
   - aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby
   - aria-expanded, aria-selected, aria-checked as appropriate

  <name>Task 1: Audit overlay components (Modal, Dropdown, CommandPalette, ConfirmDialog, Combobox)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/07-accessibility-audit/07-01-FINDINGS.md</files>
  <action>
Read each component file and audit against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria. For each component, document:

1. **Current State** - What accessibility features exist
2. **Gaps** - What's missing for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **Priority** - High/Medium/Low based on impact

**Audit checklist per component:**
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape, Tab)
- [ ] Focus trap (modal/dialog patterns)
- [ ] Focus restoration on close
- [ ] ARIA role (dialog, menu, listbox, combobox)
- [ ] ARIA states (aria-expanded, aria-selected, aria-activedescendant)
- [ ] ARIA labels (aria-label, aria-labelledby)
- [ ] Focus indicator visibility
- [ ] Screen reader announcements

Write findings to 07-01-FINDINGS.md in structured format.

Note: Dropdown already has keyboard navigation and ARIA from Phase 04-02. CommandPalette has keyboard nav from Phase 02-02.

  <name>Task 2: Audit structural components (Tabs, Accordion, Table)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/07-accessibility-audit/07-01-FINDINGS.md</files>
  <action>
Continue audit for Tabs, Accordion, and Table components. Append findings to 07-01-FINDINGS.md.

**Tabs criteria:**
- [ ] ARIA tablist, tab, tabpanel roles
- [ ] aria-selected on active tab
- [ ] aria-controls linking tab to panel
- [ ] Arrow key navigation between tabs
- [ ] Tab key moves to panel content

**Accordion criteria:**
- [ ] ARIA button + region pattern OR disclosure pattern
- [ ] aria-expanded on triggers
- [ ] aria-controls linking trigger to panel
- [ ] Enter/Space to toggle

**Table criteria:**
- [ ] Proper table semantics (if using div-based table)
- [ ] Column headers associated with cells
- [ ] Sort state announced (aria-sort)
- [ ] Filter/search accessible labels
- [ ] Selection state (aria-selected or aria-checked)
- [ ] Bulk action bar keyboard accessible
- [ ] Pagination keyboard accessible

Table has sorting, filtering, pagination, and bulk selection from Phase 3.
